    A dedicated background thread for running Modern Portfolio Theory optimizations
    with Core-Satellite (locked assets) constraints.

    This worker prevents the PySide6 UI from freezing while SciPy performs 
    complex matrix minimizations. It handles the translation of user-selected 
    "locked" assets into strict mathematical bounds, ensuring the optimizer 
    only reallocates the free "satellite" portion of the portfolio.

    Signals:
        optimization_finished (dict): Emitted upon successful calculation. Contains 
            current stats, optimal stats, frontier points, asset symbols, and weights.
        error_occurred (str): Emitted if an exception is raised during optimization.
        progress_update (str): Emitted at various stages to update UI loading states.
