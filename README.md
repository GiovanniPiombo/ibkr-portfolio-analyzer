AlphaPaths is a professional-grade desktop application for advanced risk analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and portfolio optimization. It features a modular multi-broker architecture that supports direct connections to Interactive Brokers (IBKR), Alpaca, and major Crypto Exchanges (via CCXT), or a fully functional Manual Mode using Yahoo Finance—making it accessible to any investor, regardless of their brokerage.

The platform projects future portfolio values using stochastic models (Geometric Brownian Motion & Merton Jump-Diffusion), applies Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to generate efficient frontiers with Core-Satellite constraints, and provides intelligent conversational feedback via Google's Gemini AI.

## Key Features

*   **Universal Broker Architecture:** Connect to your real account via Interactive Brokers, Alpaca (stocks & crypto), or any CCXT-compatible crypto exchange (Binance, Kraken, etc.). For those without a brokerage account, the Manual Broker reads a simple JSON file and fetches real-time prices and historical data from Yahoo Finance, with automatic FX conversion.
*   **Multi-Broker Settings:** A dedicated settings page allows you to manage credentials for all brokers and switch between them seamlessly without editing configuration files manually.
*   **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Uses Geometric Brownian Motion to project thousands of possible future portfolio paths. Calculates key scenarios: Worst Case (5th percentile), Median (50th), and Best Case (95th).
*   **Merton Jump-Diffusion Stress Testing:** Extends standard GBM by incorporating discrete price jumps (Poisson processes) to model sudden market crashes and extreme tail events, providing a more conservative risk assessment. Parameters are automatically calibrated from your portfolio's historical data using a configurable Jump Threshold.
*   **Core-Satellite Portfolio Optimization:** Applies Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to calculate the Efficient Frontier and Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio. The unique "Core-Satellite" feature allows you to "lock" strategic core assets (e.g., a broad-market ETF) at their current weight, forcing the optimizer to only reallocate the remaining "satellite" positions, perfect for maintaining long-term strategic allocations while tactically optimizing the rest.
*   **AI-Powered Insights:** Sends your portfolio composition and simulation results to Google's Gemini API, generating a structured, natural language report with personalized observations and suggestions. The prompt template is fully customizable and supports multiple languages.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Employs a multi-threaded architecture (QThread) to keep the UI responsive. Uses a FastMathWorker to instantly recalculate simulations from cached risk metrics without re-fetching historical data.
*   **Professional UI:** Clean, dark-themed interface, built with PySide6 and custom QSS styling.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic QCharts embedded in the UI display the simulation cone (with background paths and highlighted percentile lines) and the Efficient Frontier. The simulation graph supports zoom clamping, rubber-band selection, and mouse wheel zoom for detailed analysis of projection paths.

## Project Structure

The codebase is meticulously organized following the **Separation of Concerns** principle. This makes the application maintainable, testable, and scalable.

#### Post-Build Configuration

**Important**: After building the executable, you must configure the application settings:
1. Launch the executable - The application will start with default placeholder values.
2. Navigate to the Settings page - Access the dedicated settings interface
3. Configure required parameters:
   - **Gemini API Key:** Your Google AI Studio API key (required for AI Insights).
   - **Active Broker:** Select from "Interactive Brokers", "Alpaca", "Crypto Exchange", or "Manual (Yahoo Finance)".
   - **Broker Credentials:** Enter the specific API keys and settings for your chosen broker.
   - **Simulation Defaults:** Adjust risk-free rate, lookback period, jump threshold, etc.
4. Save settings - The configuration is automatically saved to config.json in the executable's directory.
   
**Note**: The first-time user must supply their own Gemini API key. The application does not include any pre-configured keys

### How to use

#### Choosing your Broker
Navigate to the Settings tab. Select your preferred broker from the "Active Broker" dropdown and fill in the required credentials for that specific connection. The app will use this selection for all subsequent data fetches.
- Interactive Brokers: Requires a running instance of TWS or IB Gateway. Configure the host, port, and client ID.
- Alpaca: Enter your API and Secret keys. Check "Paper Trading" for testnet mode.
- Crypto Exchange: Enter the CCXT exchange ID (e.g., binance, kraken), your API key, and secret. The app will automatically handle asset classification (cash vs. risky) and cross-pair price resolution.
- Manual (Yahoo Finance): Define your portfolio in manual_portfolio.json. The app will fetch real-time prices and historical data directly from Yahoo Finance and perform automatic FX conversions.

#### Interface Navigation
- **Dashboard:** Upon starting, the app automatically connects to the active broker and fetches your portfolio data. Click "Refresh Data" to manually update.
- **Simulation:** Navigate to the "Monte Carlo" tab. After the initial preload, adjust the years and number of simulations (using the intuitive sliders) and select the model type (Standard GBM or Merton Stress Test). Click "Run Simulation" to instantly see new projections.
- **Optimization:** After loading portfolio data, go to the "Optimization" tab. Lock any assets you wish to keep as your core strategic holdings by checking the box in the table. Click "Run Optimization" to calculate the constrained Efficient Frontier and the optimal Max Sharpe portfolio. The page will display the improvement in Sharpe ratio and a detailed action table with Buy/Sell/Hold recommendations for each asset.
- **AI Insights:** The AI analysis is displayed directly on the Simulation page. It automatically triggers after each simulation run, providing a detailed report on your portfolio's risk and potential in your preferred language.

## Core-Satellite Optimization

The optimization module implements a **Core-Satellite** investment strategy:

- **Core Assets (Locked):** When you check the "Lock" checkbox next to an asset in the optimization table, its current portfolio weight is frozen. The optimizer treats these assets as untouchable strategic holdings (e.g., a broad-market ETF that defines your baseline allocation).
- **Satellite Assets (Optimized):** All unlocked assets are free to be reallocated by the Markowitz optimizer. The mathematical engine (SLSQP) redistributes the remaining portfolio weight among these satellite positions to maximize the Sharpe Ratio while respecting the locked core weights.

This approach allows you to maintain your long-term strategic allocations while tactically optimizing the tactical or speculative portion of your portfolio.

## Simulation Models: GBM vs. Merton

The application offers two distinct Monte Carlo simulation models:

| Model | Description | Best Used For |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Standard GBM** (Geometric Brownian Motion) | Assumes continuous, normally distributed price movements with constant drift and volatility. | Standard market conditions, baseline projections, and when you expect relatively stable markets. |
| **Merton Stress Test** (Jump-Diffusion) | Extends GBM by adding discrete price jumps (Poisson process) to model sudden, discontinuous events like market crashes or flash crashes. | Stress testing, bear market scenarios, and when you want a more conservative risk assessment that accounts for tail risk. |

The Merton model parameters (`λ` for jump frequency, `m` for average jump size, `ν` for jump volatility) are automatically calibrated from your portfolio's historical data using the configurable **Jump Threshold** setting in the Settings page.

## Running Tests

The core mathematical logic is thoroughly tested. To run the test suite:
```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
```
