A professional-grade desktop application for advanced risk analysis and Monte Carlo simulation of financial portfolios. It features a modular broker architecture that allows users to either connect directly to **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)** for real-time account syncing or use a **Manual Mode (Yahoo Finance)** for universal portfolio tracking without requiring a brokerage account.

The platform calculates future projections using stochastic models (Geometric Brownian Motion & Merton Jump-Diffusion) and provides intelligent, conversational feedback via Google's Gemini AI. Built with a clean, decoupled architecture (PySide6, QThread, and pure Python logic), it ensures a high-performance, responsive experience for complex financial modeling.

## Key Features

*   **Direct IBKR Integration:** Automatically downloads real portfolio data (Net Liquidation Value, Cash, Positions, Daily P&L) via the `ib_async` library. Supports multi-currency portfolios with automatic FX conversion.
*   **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Uses Geometric Brownian Motion to project thousands of possible future portfolio paths. Calculates key scenarios: Worst Case (5th percentile), Median (50th), and Best Case (95th).
*   **AI-Powered Insights:** Sends your portfolio composition and simulation results to Google's Gemini API, generating a structured, natural language report with personalized observations and suggestions.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Employs a multi-threaded architecture to keep the UI responsive. Uses a "FastMathWorker" to instantly recalculate simulations from cached risk metrics without re-fetching historical data.
*   **Professional UI:** Clean, dark-themed interface inspired by Bloomberg terminals, built with PySide6 and custom QSS styling.
*   **Interactive Visualizations:** Dynamic Qcharts embedded in the UI display the simulation cone, with background paths and clearly highlighted percentile lines. The simulation graph supports interactive features including zoom clamping, rubber-band selection, and mouse wheel zoom for detailed analysis of projection paths.
*   **Merton Jump-Diffusion Stress Testing:** Extends standard GBM simulations by incorporating discrete price jumps (Poisson processes) to model sudden market crashes and extreme tail events, providing a more conservative risk assessment.
*   **Core-Satellite Portfolio Optimization:** Applies Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to calculate the Efficient Frontier and Maximum Sharpe Ratio portfolio. Allows users to "lock" strategic core asset
*   **Universal Portfolio Support (No Broker Required):** Don't use Interactive Brokers? No problem. The application features a dynamic broker architecture with a built-in `ManualBroker` adapter. It reads your holdings from a simple local JSON file and leverages Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`) to instantly fetch real-time market prices, 5-year historical data, and perform automatic FX conversions, making the app accessible to any investor right out of the box.

## Project Structure

The codebase is meticulously organized following the **Separation of Concerns** principle. This makes the application maintainable, testable, and scalable.

## Installation and Setup

You can install the application using the standalone Windows installer or set up the development environment to run and build it from the source code.

### Option 1: Windows Installer (Recommended for Users)

If you are on Windows and want a quick setup without dealing with Python environments, use the standalone installer.

1. Download the latest setup executable from the project's **Releases** page.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions provided by Inno Setup.
3. Launch the application directly from your Start Menu or Desktop shortcut.

*Note: You will still need a running instance of IBKR Trader Workstation (TWS) or IB Gateway, and a Google AI Studio API key to configure the app after installation.*

### Option 2: Development & Building from Source

Follow these steps if you want to run the application directly from the source code, contribute to the development, or build the standalone executable yourself.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher installed on your system.
- A Google AI Studio API key for the Gemini features.
- (Optional) A running instance of IBKR Trader Workstation (TWS) or IB Gateway. If you don't use IBKR, the application defaults to the built-in Manual Broker (Yahoo Finance).
- (Optional) Inno Setup installed, if you intend to build the Windows installer.

#### 1. Running from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GiovanniPiombo/ibkr-portfolio-analyzer.git
   cd ibkr-portfolio-analyzer
   ```
   
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # On macOS / Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
4. **Configure the application:**
   
   - Copy the `config.template.json` file and rename it to `config.json`.
   - Open `config.json` (or use the Settings page in the app) to configure:
     - **Gemini API Key:** Enter your Google AI Studio API key (required for AI Insights).
     - **IBKR Connection:** Verify host, port, and client ID (only if using Interactive Brokers).
     - **Simulation Defaults:** Adjust risk-free rate and other parameters.
     
5. **Run the application:**
   
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

#### 2. Build the Executable PyInstaller

The application can be packaged into a single executable file using PyInstaller, making it easy to distribute and run without a Python environment.

##### Prerequisites

- PyInstaller installed (`pip install pyinstaller`)

##### Build Instructions

1. **Ensure all dependencies are installed:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run PyInstaller with the provided spec file:**

   ```bash
   pyinstaller build.spec --clean
   ```

3. **Locate the executable:**
   
   - The built executable will be in the dist/ folder.
   - On Windows: dist/IBKR Portfolio Analyzer.exe
   - The build includes application icons (Icon.ico, Icon.png, IconSetup.ico) embedded in the executable and used for the window icon.
     
##### What the Build Includes

- All Python dependencies bundled with the executable
- Application assets (icons, stylesheets) embedded via the spec file
- Configuration files (config.json, prompts.json) - these must be present in the same directory as the executable at runtime
- Optimized build with --clean flag to ensure a fresh compilation

#### Post-Build Configuration

**Important**: After building the executable, you must configure the application settings:
1. Launch the executable - The application will start with default placeholder values.
2. Navigate to the Settings page - Access the dedicated settings interface
3. Configure required parameters:
   - Gemini API Key: Enter your Google AI Studio API key (required for AI Insights feature)
   - IBKR Connection: Verify host (default: 127.0.0.1), port (default: 4002), and client ID (default: 1)
   - Simulation Defaults: Adjust risk-free rate and other parameters as needed
4. Save settings - The configuration is automatically saved to config.json in the executable's directory.
   
**Note**: The first-time user must supply their own Gemini API key. The application does not include any pre-configured keys

### How to use

#### Choosing your Broker
By default, the application is set to use the **Manual Broker (Yahoo Finance)**, which requires no API keys and is ready out-of-the-box:
1. Copy the provided `manual_portfolio.template.json` in the root directory and rename it to `manual_portfolio.json`.
2. Edit this file to define your base currency, cash balance, and positions using standard Yahoo Finance tickers (e.g., `"AAPL"`, `"VWCE.DE"`, `"BTC-USD"`).
3. The app will automatically fetch real-time prices, historical data, and handle FX conversions.

*(Note: To connect your real Interactive Brokers account, go to the **Settings** tab, select "Interactive Brokers" as the Active Broker, and ensure TWS/Gateway is running).*

#### Interface Navigation
* **Dashboard:** Upon starting, the app automatically connects to the active broker and fetches your portfolio data. Click the "Refresh Data" button to manually update.
* **Simulation:** Navigate to the "Simulation" tab. The first time you visit, it will automatically start a background preload (fetching historical data and calculating base risk metrics). Once preloaded, you can adjust the years and number of simulations and click "Run Simulation" for instant results.
* **Optimization:** After loading portfolio data, navigate to the "Optimization" tab. Select which assets you want to "lock" (core holdings) by checking the boxes in the table. Click "Run Optimization" to calculate the constrained Efficient Frontier and the optimal Max Sharpe portfolio. The page will display the improvement in Sharpe ratio and a detailed action table with Buy/Sell/Hold recommendations for each asset.
* **AI Insights:** After running a simulation, go to the "AI Insights" tab. The AI analysis will trigger automatically, providing a detailed report on your portfolio's risk and potential.
* **Settings:** A dedicated interface that allows you to configure Gemini API keys, IBKR connection parameters (host, port, client ID), and simulation defaults without manually editing the JSON file.

## Core-Satellite Optimization

The optimization module implements a **Core-Satellite** investment strategy:

- **Core Assets (Locked):** When you check the "Lock" checkbox next to an asset in the optimization table, its current portfolio weight is frozen. The optimizer treats these assets as untouchable strategic holdings (e.g., a broad-market ETF that defines your baseline allocation).
- **Satellite Assets (Optimized):** All unlocked assets are free to be reallocated by the Markowitz optimizer. The mathematical engine (SLSQP) redistributes the remaining portfolio weight among these satellite positions to maximize the Sharpe Ratio while respecting the locked core weights.

This approach allows you to maintain your long-term strategic allocations while tactically optimizing the tactical or speculative portion of your portfolio.

## Simulation Models: GBM vs. Merton

The application offers two distinct Monte Carlo simulation models:

| Model | Description | Best Used For |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Standard GBM** (Geometric Brownian Motion) | Assumes continuous, normally distributed price movements with constant drift and volatility. | Standard market conditions, baseline projections, and when you expect relatively stable markets. |
| **Merton Stress Test** (Jump-Diffusion) | Extends GBM by adding discrete price jumps (Poisson process) to model sudden, discontinuous events like market crashes or flash crashes. | Stress testing, bear market scenarios, and when you want a more conservative risk assessment that accounts for tail risk. |

The Merton model parameters (`λ` for jump frequency, `m` for average jump size, `ν` for jump volatility) are automatically calibrated from your portfolio's historical data using the configurable **Jump Threshold** setting in the Settings page.

## Running Tests

The core mathematical logic is thoroughly tested. To run the test suite:
```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
```
